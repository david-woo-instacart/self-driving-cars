v1 - Naive model based on height. raw data and run naive version of ransac.
v2 - Run ransac to filter for inliers as ground plane

Point_Cloud_Camera_Projection_v2 - rewriting 

Submissions.


2. DONE - Draw the pointcloud data projected on the camera image - Point_Cloud_Camera_Projection_v4 - also applied heat map
3. a)  Annotate the 3D box around car visible in pointcloud 
3. b) DONE - Draw the projected box on the camera image (File :Point_Cloud_Camera_Projection_v4)
4. DONE - Implement a ground plane segmentation algorithm on pointcloud data - kitti-dataset-Plane-segment-v2
